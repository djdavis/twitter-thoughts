## Twitter Thoughts

This is a Python project to scrape Twitter for "thoughts" and stores them in S3 as JSON, every ten minutes.

Twitter is a self-replenishing resource; there is new data being generated by millions every minute. I thought it would be very 
cool if this data was available in outside of Twitter. While this is only a text mining project for now, 
the possibilities are endless.

### Deployment:
`serverless deploy`

### To Do/Ideas:

1. Perform text sentiment analysis on results: we only want positive thoughts!
2. Add variation to the hash-tags we're searching for (ex. SundayMotivation, ThursdayThoughts, etc)
3. Create Alexa Skill to read the tweets stored in S3 via an Alexa-enabled device
4. Write unit tests!
